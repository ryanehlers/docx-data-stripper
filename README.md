# Docx Data Stripper

Tool built in Python 3.5.2 for stripping metadata from Microsoft Word Docx files in a given directory, using https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx

To compile, ensure `virtualenv` is installed for use with Python 3, then <br />
`source bin/activate` <br />
`python3 app.py` <br />

You'll then be asked for the directory. Press OK to copy and strip.

It's also possible to use the tool without compiling with `app.exe`
